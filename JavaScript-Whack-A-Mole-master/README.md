## JavaScript Whack-A-Mole!
This is an old* project inspired by **Wes Bos** Whack-A-Mole game. Really fun game!
When the Game Start, by clicking on the title, a Mole will "Pop" from a random Hole, with a random duration. Every successful "Whack" will add 1 to the Score. The game ends after 10 seconds have passed.
### Features
  - **Epic graphics**.
  - A **10 seconds** countdown.
  - Each Mole will "Pop" from a **random** hole.
  - Each Mole will be "Whackable" with a **random** amount of time.
  - When the game is over, you can enter a name and it will display a **Scoreboard**.
  - Scoreboard data will be stored in **Local Storage**.

This was made with only pure **vanilla JavaScript**.
